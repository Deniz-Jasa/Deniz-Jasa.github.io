# Deniz Jasarbasic - A data scientist in the making!

Created in ReactJS, this personal website will feature information about myself, my education, and my personal projects. It will also highlight ways to contact me directly about my projects, skills, and ideas. I am always looking to connect, chat, and meet new people everyday.
